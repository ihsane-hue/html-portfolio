<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Just a fresh applied mathematics graduate. Finally achieving her life dream of becoming an engineer, specializing in artificial intelligence, 
  full of hope and excitement about what she can give to this world.
</p>

<p>But the currect situation is not helping at all, working in a field where she thought people were finally kind and far from 
  the hypocrisy of the corporate world, but little did she know that when money comes to play, the upper people don't care about a new employee.
  So she locks in again. And here she is, taking a new course, sticking to her dream of a truly, not happy (altho it would be very good), but a 
  serene life.
</p>

<p>I don't know if anyone would stumble upon this page. And I would probably change it up so I don't seem like a whiny graduate. Showing off my creativity and 
  will to give amazing ideas to this world would be and is certainly more optimistic and endearing. 
  So hello stranger, send a mail if you ever stumble upon me, it would make my day.
